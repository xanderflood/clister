summarizes the contents of simple C headers

This project uses the libclang library to process C header files, extracting funciton declarations and describing them in a simple, easy-to-process format. The intention is to use it to automatically generate Ruby FFI bindings for C code in order to take advantage of the numerous benefits to testing your code in a language different from that in which it was written.
